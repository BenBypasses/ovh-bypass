ovhudp: This bypass spoofs to cloudflare ips wich are whitlisted by most ovh's so everything you send out will be received by the target.

hydra-hex: This bypass uses randomised encrypted std hex strings.

digitalocean: This spoofs to digitalocean ips.

100up: This completely bypasses 100up firewall but if they have a dualip kill all then you would have to hit both of their ips.

fivem: This will basicly connect to the fivem server draining its bandwidth you need alot of power for this tho.

voxility: Use port 9874 with randomized tcp flags and you can slam any voxility server.

REQUIREMENTS: You need a spoofed server ofc.
